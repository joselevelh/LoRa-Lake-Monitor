# LoRa-Lake-Monitor
This is the repository for the LoRaWAN version of the prototype lake water quality monitor.
This project is an open source water quality monitor to increase the awareness and monitoring ability of water quality in lakes and other water bodies near urban/suburban areas. Many water sources near human developement are improperly managed and rarely monitored. In many circumstances, lakes and rivers near urbanized areas are used to irrigate gardens or for recreation. This makes monitoring the level pesticide and other chemical runoff important to the health and wellbeing of citizens in that area.

This project aims to create a low cost implementation for cities and/or independant neighborhoods to track their nearby water bodies and share this information with its citizens. It is pivotal to the nature of smart city management that all data gathered be public and non-personal. It is not ethical to gather and store data that may be used to profit on personal information or usage patterns for marketing or otherwise.
For this reason, devices used to gather data on water quality should be properly placed and suffficiently communicated with the surrounding citizens and should be moved if any citizens reasonably affected desire it to be.

Lastly, while this project aims to acheive the highest accuracy and security of data, it does not, and cannot be used to replace licensed professional water testing and should not be used to this capacity. This project should be at most, used to detect possible anomolies which can trigger further testing of water bodies.
